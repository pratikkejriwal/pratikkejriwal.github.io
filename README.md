# Pratik Kejriwal

I am a Software Engineer at [Cerner]("https://www.cerner.com/in/en") since January 2019, working with the Reporting and Analysis team. I write scripts to extract data and create analytical reports which are used by Hospitals to facilitate their daily Operations and help in Auditing, Business Analysis, Research and meeting Regulatory compliance. I also help in developing internal tools which are aimed to reduce the turn-around time and work effort.

I graduated from [Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore]("https://vit.ac.in/") in 2019, with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
